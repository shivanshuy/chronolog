It dates to 1953, and is in very good original condition. This is a rare Futurematic model as the dial is a different design to most that were manufactured. The power reserve register displays red cross hatching in the quadrant which indicates that the watch is running down. It has batons and Arabic numerals to mark the hours as opposed to batons and pyramid dots. The two subsidiary registers are a little smaller than the regular model so the hands are also smaller. The case and factory original dial (most dial refinishers cannot replicate this design) present very well and the movement is running strongly and keeping time. A new good quality strap has just been fitted and the crystal was replaced recently so this lovely watch is ready to wear. It is correctly signed on the case, dial and movement.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Futurematic is one of the most collectible and innovative models manufactured by this famous company and probably second only to the Reverso in their vintage model range . Even today it looks futuristic and when I list one for sale, it always attracts considerable interest. The watch displays a chronograph style dial with two registers, a power reserve indicator and a seconds dial. The case houses an automatic \u201cbumper\u201d movement, especially designed for the Futurematic model. Jaeger LeCoultre was so confident about the quality of this new movement that the company decided not to spoil the aesthetics of the watch by adding a crown. Instead it has a disc on the back cover which slides inwards to set the time.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA watch with a \u201cbumper\u201d movement is always in demand from collectors. If you look at the photographs you can see that the rotor does not turn continuously through 360 degrees but bounces back and forth through around 300 degrees. Older Omega watches also had this type of movement. These two companies probably manufactured more bumper watches than any other watchmaker. This watch is correctly signed by the manufacturer in three places, on the dial, case and movement.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDial: finished in satin silver and signed \u201cLeCoultre Futurematic Swiss". The power reserve indicator is located at the 9 o\'clock position and the subsidiary seconds dial is located at 3 o\'clock. Gold coloured batons and Arabic numerals mark the hours and the gold coloured hands are in good shape The recently replaced crystal is clean and clear. The dial is showing patina as is to be expected with a watch of this age ((66 years) but I consider the condition to be very nice and much to good to consider any restoration, particularly as the dial is so rare.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tCase: 10 carat gold filled in good condition, measuring approximately 35 mm across and 44 mm from lug to lug. The inside of the case is signed LeCoultre". The case shows the expected marks from use over the years. All that I could see to point out to you is a couple of small nicks on the side of the case which look to be tool marks caused by opening the case. You can see them in the ante-penultimate photo below.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMovement: high quality cal. 497 17 jewel automatic bumper movement, signed \u201cLeCoultre Co\u201d, running well and keeping time. The complicated movement has a function which automatically stops the watch from winding when it is fully wound to reduce wear to the mechanism. And when the watch is nearly run down and is not being worn, it will hold a small power reserve so that when it is picked up it will run for a few hours without further winding. The bumper unit is an early automatic movement, first seen in watches in the late 1940\'s, with many Jaeger LeCoultre and Omega watches housing them up to the mid 1950\'s. Unlike the modern rotors which sit on top of the mechanism and rotate through 360 degrees, the bumper rotor rotates through a little over 300 degrees, hits a sprung stop which cushions the impact of the hammer action and helps sends the rotor to swing back to a stop on the other side of the movement. It should be "kick started" when first used by shaking the watch back and forth gently for a few minutes. You will see the power reserve indicator moving out of the red as the watch winds. When it is fully wound the watch will automatically stop winding. Older automatics are not as efficient as modern day mechanisms, (and we tend to lead more sedentary lives than 68 years ago). Therefore, depending on how much use and movement the watch receives when worn, it may need manual winding from time to time by shaking the watch back and forth it for a couple of minutes or so .\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tStrap: fitted with a new generic brown lizard grain strap which fitted to the watch measures approximately 206 mm from buckle tip to last hole.\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\t<div class="home-watch-grid-column-3">\r\n\t\t<div class="home-watch-grid-column-row-1">\r\n\t\t\t<div class="home-watch-grid-cell">\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class="home-watch-grid-cell-cell-3">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class="home-watch-grid-watch-name">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJaeger Lecoultre Futurematic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class="home-watch-grid-watch-desc">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10K Gold Filled Automatic Bumper Watch 1953\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class="home-watch-grid-cell-cell-1">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t<div class="home-watch-grid-column-row-5">\r\n\t\t\t<div class="home-watch-grid-cell"></div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>'},function(t,e){t.exports='<div class="home-watch-grid">\r\n\t<div class="home-watch-grid-column-4">\r\n\t\t<div class="home-watch-grid-column-row-1">\r\n\t\t\t<div class="home-watch-grid-cell">\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class="img-box1">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class="img-watch-responsive" src="./images/hmtChinar.jfif">\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t<div class="home-watch-grid-column-row-4">\r\n\t\t\t<div class="home-watch-grid-cell">\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class="home-watch-grid-watch-details">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA gentlemans\' 10 carat gold filled Futurematic automatic bumper wrist watch made by Jaeger LeCoultre.

But the traditional watch wheel train\u2013a design rooted in the 17th century\u2013does not easily allow for a center seconds display. The center wheel is in the center of the movement and, rotating once each hour, carries the minute hand. It is the fourth wheel that rotates once each minute, and because the center wheel is in the center, the fourth wheel can\u2019t be. Thus, seconds display has traditionally been done with a small hand at 6 o\u2019clock attached directly to the fourth wheel pinion.</div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>First popular in the late 1940\u2019s, center seconds designs have taken as many twists and turns as a fast beat balance. Like so much technological change, it is often difficult to understand in retrospect why it was so slow and incremental. One thing was clear in the beginning:  the center wheel was in the center of the movement and it needed to be there to drive the centrally pivoted minute hand.</div>\r\n\t\t\t<img class="img-watch-responsive" src="/images/subsidiarySecond.jpg" />\r\n\t\t\t<div>The fourth wheel, rotating once per minute, quite naturally carried the seconds hand (right). Although there were rare exceptions, this was how it was done for the first two and one half centuries of the watch. The design had more utility in watches. In the wristwatch, however, the seconds hand seemed barely to move at a quick glance, and ran on a track that was often too small to read with the naked eye</div>\r\n\t\t\t<div><b>Indirect Center Seconds</b></div>\r\n\t\t\t<img class="img-watch-responsive" src="/images/indirectCenterSeconds.jpg" />\r\n\t\t\t<div>Predictably, the first center-seconds designs\u2013indirect center seconds\u2014 left the center and fourth wheels where they \u201cbelonged\u201d (below left). With this design, the center wheel drives the third wheel and the third wheel the fourth wheel. But the third wheel (usually) drove a seconds pinion, often via an intermediate wheel.</div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>The rotational speed of the seconds hand could be adjusted by determining the ratio between the third wheel and seconds pinion and, if present, the intermediate wheel. The extended seconds pinion ran through a hallow center wheel pinion and carried the seconds hand in the center of the movement.</div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>Indirect-center seconds worked, and is seen in many very fine older watches. The design suffers a few short comings. It usually costs a substantial increase in the thickness of the movement. With the exception of very refined designs like the Patek 12\u201d\u2019-120, the seconds hand, which is outside the power flow, tends to flutter. For this reason a tensioning spring that rides on the seconds pinion is often used, as illustrated in the diagram above. The adjustment of the spring is quite critical, and poor adjustment will produce low amplitude or poor motion of the seconds hand. Indirect center seconds are still used in more expensive movements like the Jaeger LeCoultre caliber 889, Patek caliber 315, and some some Piguets. In less expensive movements, where the complexity and cost are prohibitive, indirect center seconds is now rarely seen.</div>\r\n\t\t\t<div><b>Direct Center Seconds</b></div>\r\n\t\t\t<img class="img-watch-responsive" src="/images/directSweep.jpg" />\r\n\t\t\t<div></div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>'},function(t,e){t.exports='<div class="home-tech-grid">\r\n\t<div class="home-tech-grid-row-1">\r\n\t\t<div class="home-tech-grid-row-column-1">\r\n\t\t\t<div class="home-tech-grid-topic-desc">\r\n\t\t\t\tDetail of Watch Movement\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t<div><div></div></div>\r\n\t\t<div class="home-tech-grid-row-column-3">\r\n\t\t\t<div class="home-tech-grid-topic-title">\r\n\t\t\t\tWatch Movement\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\t<div class="home-tech-grid-row-n">\r\n\t\t<div class="home-tech-grid-content-text">\r\n\t\t\t<img class="img-watch-responsive" src="/images/gear-train.jpg" />\r\n\t\t\t<div>The diagram below shows the typical gear train of a watch. The escapement of a watch begins with the escape wheel. Next you will have the pallet. The pallet makes contact with the balance wheel as shown in the diagram. The balance wheel swings back and forth and with each swing locks and unlocks the pallet as it engages the escape wheel. This arc-of-motion can range from 18,000 beats per hour to as much as 28,000 beats per hour on some wrist watches.</div>\r\n\t\t\t<img class="img-watch-responsive" src="/images/gear-train-2.jpg" />\r\n\t\t\t<div>The sketch shows the flow of power from the great wheel through the train to the escapement. The great wheel, which might be on a going barrel or a fusee, drives the pinion of the centre wheel. The minute hand is mounted on the arbor of the centre wheel so it must turn once an hour. The centre wheel turns the pinion of the third wheel, and the third wheel turns the pinion of the fourth wheel. The fourth wheel drives the pinion of the escape wheel, which is locked by the pallets on the lever until a swing of the balance unlocks a pallet and the escape wheel can advance by one tooth. From number of teeth on each wheel and pinion in the train you can work out how fast each wheel is turning and how many vibrations the escapement makes in an hour.</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>'},,,function(t,e,a){t.exports=a(37)},,,,,,function(t,e){t.exports='<div class="blog-box-container">\r\n    <div class="blog-heading">\r\n                <div class="blog-text">Seiko 6602-8050</div>    \r\n                <div class="blog-time-right">Japan / 1970</div>\r\n                <div class="blog-heading-divider">\r\n                    <div class="blog-heading-divider-bar"></div>\r\n                    <div class="blog-heading-time-right">16/12/2019</div>\r\n                </div>\r\n    </div>    \r\n    <div class="blog-box">\r\n        <div class="blog-box-left">\r\n            <div class="blog-box-container-text">\r\n                <div class="blog-box-left-heading">Bit of Story</div>\r\n                <div>This was my first Seiko watch which I baught in nice wearable condition along with a beautiful HMT Chinar.\r\n                I still remeber my conversation wwith the seller which was from Kerala.\r\n                I started collection watches recently and was slightly apprehensive.
