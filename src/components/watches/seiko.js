                        <div>This was my first Seiko watch which I baught in nice wearable condition along with a beautiful HMT Chinar.
                          I still remeber my conversation wwith the seller which was from Kerala.
          I started collection watches recently and was slightly apprehensive. So I asked some quetions to ensure authenticity of the watch and the answer I got was "100% authentic. This is Kerala." Later I baught number of beutiful watches from  same seller.</div>

                    <div>The 6600 series was a family of mechanical watch movements from Seiko in the 1960's.
        The 6602B movement was the work horse manual winder from that period(from 1968). It is a rock solid and very reliable calibre, evidenced by there being so many that are still working.</div>
